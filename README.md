# AI-Based Facial Generation System

## Project Summary
This project develops an **AI facial generation system** using modern generative models such as **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)**, **Diffusion Models**, and **Flow Matching**. It converts random latent noise into realistic human-face images through advanced deep-learning architecture trained on the **CelebA/FFHQ datasets**. The final objective is to provide a web-based visualization tool that allows users to compare generated faces, analyze model metrics (FID score, loss plots), and document AI performance across iterations.

## 👨‍💻 Team & Responsibilities
This project is currently transitioning from the **Dataset Setup** phase to the **Model Training** phase.
